## Getting Started

Get started by **installing the module**.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.14 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Installing the module

You can install the module with your prefered package manager

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
  defaultValue="npm"
  values= {[
    { label: 'npm', value: 'npm', },
    { label: 'yarn', value: 'yarn', },
    { label: 'pnpm', value: 'pnpm', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="npm">

```bash
npm install mr.gil
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarn add mr.gil
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="pnpm">

```bash
pnpm add mr.gil
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Mr.Gil

Don't worry, `Mr.Gil` is lightweight.

## You're good to go 👏

:::tip Tip
### You worked with discord.js ?
- Thats awesome ! Because `Mr.Gil` is very similar to discord.js syntax

Don't get scared 😱. It's similar to DJS v13 syntax 😊

So you don't need to memorize everything. That can be a headstart 🚀
